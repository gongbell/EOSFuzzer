This Agreement shall be subject to the Ricardian Terms of the Chintai Smart Contract (the \"Terms\"), which are incorporated herein by reference. The intention of the author (\"Chintai\" a/k/a \"we\" or \"our\") and the invoker (`account_name` a/k/a \"you\" or \"your\") of this Contract, as described more fully below, is to communicate the desire of `account_name` to stake or lease EOS Tokens by and through the Chintai Smart Contract on the lease terms specified in `memo` (the \"Order\").\r\n\r\nOrders may be Stake Orders or Lease Orders. \r\n\r\nStake Orders are offers by `account_name` (a lessor) to stake EOS Tokens so that others (lessees) may use the corresponding CPU and/or bandwidth in exchange for a rental fee. Stake Orders must state a minimum rental fee the lessor is willing to receive and a lease length. \r\n\r\nFor Stake Orders, `memo` must be in the format \"`user`|`side`|`quantity`|`interest`|`duration`|`random`\" where the elements are as follows:\r\n* `user` must be `account_name`\r\n* `side` must be 0 for Stake Orders\r\n* `quantity` must specify the quantity of EOS Tokens to stake\r\n* `interest` must specify the minimum acceptable rental fee, in EOS Tokens, per EOS Token staked\r\n* `duration` must specify the lease length, in days, and must be one of 3, 7, 14, or 21\r\n* `random` must specify one or more random alphanumeric characters used to uniquely identify the Stake Order.\r\n\r\nFor example, prepare(\"johnqpublicx|0|50|.1|3|order1\") specifies an Order, by EOS Account johnqpublicx, to stake 50 EOS for 3 days, in exchange for a minimum rental fee of 50*.1 = 5 EOS; order1 is a string to identify the order. \r\n\r\nIf accepted, a Stake Order must be followed by transfer of the EOS Tokens to stake, from `account_name` to Chintai, and then Chintai::activate. In each case, the `memo` parameter must be the same as submitted for Chintai::prepare. Continuing the same example, prepare must be followed by transfer(\"johnqpublicx\", \"Chintai\", \"50.0000 EOS\", \"johnqpublicx|0|50|.1|3|order1\") and Chintai::activate(\"johnqpublicx|0|50|.1|3|order1\").\r\n\r\nLease Orders are offers by `account_name` (a lessee) to lease the CPU and/or bandwidth corresponding to others\u2019 (lessors\u2019) EOS Tokens in exchange for a rental fee. Lease Orders must state a maximum rental fee the lessee is willing to pay and a lease length.\r\n\r\nFor Lease Orders, `memo` must be in the format \"`user`|`side`|`quantity`|`interest`|`duration`|`ratio`|`random`\" where the elements are as follows:\r\n* `user` must be `account_name`\r\n* `side` must be 1 for Lease Orders\r\n* `quantity` must specify the quantity of EOS Tokens worth of CPU and/or bandwidth to lease\r\n* `interest` must specify the maximum acceptable rental fee, in EOS Tokens, per EOS Token leased\r\n* `duration` must specify the lease length, in days, and must be one of 3, 7, 14, or 21\r\n* `ratio` must specify the percentage of `quantity` to be allocated to CPU (as opposed to bandwidth)\r\n* `random` must specify one or more random alphanumeric characters used to uniquely identify the Lease Order.\r\n\r\nFor example, \"johnqpublicy|1|80|.2|3|.4|order2\" specifies an Order, by EOS Account johnqpublicy, to lease 80 EOS for 3 days, in exchange for a maximum rental fee of 80*.2 = 16 EOS, with 80*.4 = 32 EOS allocated to CPU and the remainder (48 EOS) allocated to bandwidth; order2 is a string to identify the order. \r\n\r\nIf accepted, a Lease Order must be followed by transfer of the maximum rental fee, from `account_name` to Chintai, and then Chintai::activate. In each case, the `memo` parameter must be the same as submitted for Chintai::prepare. Continuing the same example, prepare must be followed by transfer(\"johnqpublicy\", \"Chintai\", \"16.0000 EOS\", \"johnqpublicy|1|80|.2|3|.4|order2\") and Chintai::activate(\"johnqpublicy|1|80|.2|3|.4|order2\").\r\n\r\nUpon activation of an Order, Chintai shall attempt to match it to the earlier-activated Orders of the opposite type in order of preference so as to maximize the rental fee for a later-activated Stake Order and minimize the rental fee for a later-activated Lease Order. Chintai shall only match Orders of the same duration for which the minimum rental fee per EOS Token of the Stake Order is less than the maximum rental fee per EOS Token of the Lease Order. \r\n\r\nThe quantity of any match shall be that of the smaller Order; such Order shall be deemed completely filled and the other Order shall be deemed partially filled and reduced in quantity accordingly. The rental fee per EOS Token of any match shall be that of the earlier-activated Order, and the total rental fee shall be that number multiplied by the quantity of the match. Within a reasonable time, Chintai shall refund to the lessee any excess of the maximum rental fee previously transferred over the total rental fee of the match, prorated for the quantity of the match in proportion to the quantity of the Lease Order. Chintai shall transfer to the lessor the quantity of the match plus the total rental fee of the match at the conclusion of the lease duration or within a reasonable time thereof. Chintai shall then attempt to match any partially filled Orders using the same process.\r\n\r\nContinuing the above examples, if johnqpublicx activated \"johnqpublicx|0|50|.1|3|order1\" and johnqpublicy then activated \"johnqpublicy|1|80|.2|3|.4|order2\", and no other Orders were active, they would match because they are of the same duration (3 days) and .1 is less than .2. The quantity of the match would be 50 because 50 is less than 80; order1 would be deemed completely filled, and order2 would be deemed partially filled and reduced in quantity to 80-50=30. The rental fee per EOS Token of the match would be .1 because order1 would be the earlier-activated Order. The total rental fee would be 50*.1=5 EOS Tokens. Chintai would refund (.2-.1)*(50/80)=.0625 EOS Tokens to johnqpublicy, and would transfer 50+5=55 EOS Tokens to johnqpublicx in 3 days. Chintai would have then attempted to match the the reduced quantity order2 if any other Orders were active.\r\n\r\nChintai shall have sole discretion as to whether to accept or reject any Order, and shall communicate said decision in response to this action. If Chintai accepts:\r\n* `account_name` represents and warrants that, within 5 minutes of pushing this Chintai::prepare action, `account_name` will (i) transfer to Chintai the amount of EOS Tokens appropriate to the Order, with the `memo` parameter of the transfer the same as submitted for Chintai::prepare, and (ii) then invoke Chintai::activate, with the `memo` parameter of that action the same as well. A failure to take any of these steps shall result in the Order being cancelled. \r\n* `account_name` agrees that a reasonable and appropriate amount of `account_name`\u2019s RAM will be allocated by and to Chintai to store information regarding the Order and any leases resulting from the Order. If enough RAM is not available, the Order will be cancelled. \r\n\r\nIf `account_name` transfers EOS Tokens to Chintai other than in accordance with the foregoing, Chintai shall use reasonable efforts to return such EOS Tokens. Chintai shall free any RAM allocated as above when this Contract expires. \r\n\r\n`account_name` may cancel unfilled or partially filled Orders by invoking Chintai::cancelorder. Upon the cancellation of any Order for any reason, Chintai shall return any EOS Tokens corresponding to the Order held on `account_name`\u2019s behalf. This shall not include EOS Tokens corresponding to any leases resulting from the Order, unless otherwise provided for in the Terms. `account_name` agrees that leases resulting from the Order cannot be canceled unless otherwise provided for in the Terms. \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all of the above, in no case shall Chintai return, refund or otherwise transfer any funds frozen pursuant to the Terms. \r\n\r\n### Term\r\nTERM.
