not subjected to or conditioned upon any terms.\nThe {{newpackage.provider}} will keep his servers maintained and secured, with only the DSP having access to features connected with the PKG and services provided.\nshould the DSP use, within the course of providing the services under the PKG, any technique, code or smart contract developed, amended, adapted, upgraded or otherwise altered by the DSP, DSP accepts liability for any and all provable damages that result from such actions of the DSP, unless specifically stated otherwise.  \nIt will not interfere with, harm, infringe, breach or otherwise abuse the DAPP Network, its ongoing operations, related terms and conditions (as may be applicable) and any of its users rights.\nI agree to process all producer election transactions that occur in blocks I create, to sign all objectively valid blocks I create that contain election transactions, and to sign all pre-confirmation and confirmations necessary to facilitate the transfer of control to the next set of producers as determined by the system contract.\nDSPu2019s offering and/or supplying of PKGu2019s will not subject DSP to any limitations, other than explicitly set forth herein. \nShould DSP maintain a website related to the PKGu2019s which contains supported by the DSP, DSP may include at its sole discretion additional terms and conditions applicable to DSPu2019s
